# GitHub Actions Maintenance Guide

## Overview

This guide establishes procedures for maintaining GitHub Actions workflows to prevent deployment failures and ensure reliable CI/CD operations. Following the critical deployment lessons learned, this guide provides comprehensive maintenance procedures to keep GitHub Actions workflows current and functional.

## 🔧 Workflow Maintenance Schedule

### Monthly Maintenance Tasks

#### 1. Action Version Updates
```yaml
# Check for updates to GitHub Actions
- uses: actions/checkout@v4        # Update from v3 to v4
- uses: actions/setup-python@v5    # Update from v4 to v5
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4      # Update from v3 to v4
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 # Update from v3 to v4
```

#### 2. Dependency Version Reviews
```yaml
# Review and update dependency versions
- name: Setup Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: '3.11'  # Review for newer Python versions

- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'      # Review for newer Node.js LTS versions
```

#### 3. Security Scanning Tool Updates
```yaml
# Keep security tools current
- name: Install Security Tools
  run: |
    pip install --upgrade bandit safety semgrep
    npm audit fix  # Fix npm security vulnerabilities
```

### Weekly Maintenance Tasks

#### 1. Workflow Health Checks
- Review recent workflow runs for failures
- Check workflow execution times for performance degradation
- Validate all required secrets are properly configured
- Verify environment variable configurations

#### 2. Dependency Cache Management
```yaml
# Cache management for performance
- name: Cache Python Dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/pip
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

- name: Cache Node Dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-node-
```

## 📋 Version Management

### GitHub Actions Version Tracking

#### Current Action Versions (as of 2025-08-18)
```yaml
# Core Actions
actions/checkout: v4
actions/setup-python: v5
actions/setup-node: v4
actions/cache: v3
actions/upload-artifact: v4
actions/download-artifact: v4

# Third-party Actions
railway/cli: latest
github/super-linter: v4
```

#### Version Update Process
1. **Check for Updates**: Monthly review of action versions
2. **Test Updates**: Test new versions in feature branches
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Update staging workflows first
4. **Production Update**: Update production workflows after validation
5. **Documentation**: Update this guide with new versions

### Dependency Management

#### Python Dependencies
```bash
# Regular dependency updates
pip list --outdated
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

#### Node.js Dependencies
```bash
# Regular dependency updates
npm outdated
npm update
npm audit fix
```

#### Security Dependency Updates
```bash
# Security-focused updates
pip install --upgrade bandit safety
npm audit fix --force
```

## 🔍 Workflow Monitoring

### Performance Monitoring

#### Workflow Execution Time Tracking
```yaml
# Add timing to workflow steps
- name: Deployment with Timing
  run: |
    start_time=$(date +%s)
    # Deployment commands here
    end_time=$(date +%s)
    echo "Deployment took $((end_time - start_time)) seconds"
```

#### Resource Usage Monitoring
```yaml
# Monitor resource usage
- name: System Resources
  run: |
    echo "CPU Info:"
    nproc
    echo "Memory Info:"
    free -h
    echo "Disk Info:"
    df -h
```

### Failure Analysis

#### Common Failure Patterns
1. **Deprecated Action Versions**: Regular version updates prevent deprecation issues
2. **Missing Secrets**: Validate all required secrets are configured
3. **Environment Conflicts**: Ensure consistent environment configurations
4. **Cache Corruption**: Regular cache invalidation and management
5. **Network Timeouts**: Implement retry mechanisms for network operations

#### Failure Response Procedures
```yaml
# Implement retry mechanisms
- name: Deploy with Retry
  uses: nick-invision/retry@v2
  with:
    timeout_minutes: 10
    max_attempts: 3
    command: |
      # Deployment commands with retry logic
```

## 🛡️ Security Maintenance

### Security Scanning Updates

#### Tool Version Management
```yaml
# Keep security tools current
- name: Update Security Tools
  run: |
    # Python security tools
    pip install --upgrade bandit safety semgrep

    # Node.js security tools
    npm install -g npm-audit-resolver
    npm audit fix
```

#### Security Policy Updates
```yaml
# Security scanning with updated policies
- name: Security Scan
  run: |
    # Bandit with updated configuration
    bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json -c .bandit

    # Safety with updated database
    safety check --json --output safety-report.json --db

    # Semgrep with latest rules
    semgrep --config=auto --json --output=semgrep-report.json .
```

### Secrets Management

#### Secret Rotation Schedule
- **Monthly**: Rotate API keys and tokens
- **Quarterly**: Review and update all secrets
- **Annually**: Complete security audit of secret management

#### Secret Validation
```yaml
# Validate required secrets
- name: Validate Secrets
  run: |
    # Check for required secrets
    if [ -z "${{ secrets.RAILWAY_TOKEN_PRODUCTION }}" ]; then
      echo "Missing RAILWAY_TOKEN_PRODUCTION secret"
      exit 1
    fi

    if [ -z "${{ secrets.LANGSMITH_API_KEY_PROD }}" ]; then
      echo "Missing LANGSMITH_API_KEY_PROD secret"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## 🚨 Emergency Maintenance Procedures

### Critical Workflow Failures

#### Immediate Response
1. **Identify Failure**: Use `gh run watch --exit-status` to monitor real-time status
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine if failure affects production deployments
3. **Implement Workaround**: Use manual deployment procedures if necessary
4. **Fix Root Cause**: Address underlying workflow issues
5. **Validate Fix**: Test workflow fixes in staging environment
6. **Document Incident**: Record failure cause and resolution

#### Emergency Rollback
```yaml
# Emergency workflow rollback
- name: Emergency Rollback
  if: failure()
  run: |
    echo "Workflow failed - initiating emergency rollback"
    # Rollback commands here
    railway rollback --environment production
```

### Deprecated Action Handling

#### Deprecation Response Process
1. **Identify Deprecated Actions**: Monitor GitHub deprecation notices
2. **Plan Migration**: Create migration plan for deprecated actions
3. **Test Alternatives**: Validate replacement actions in staging
4. **Update Workflows**: Implement new actions in production
5. **Monitor Results**: Ensure new actions work correctly

#### Common Deprecation Scenarios
```yaml
# Example: Migrating from deprecated actions
# OLD (deprecated)
- uses: actions/setup-node@v2  # DEPRECATED

# NEW (current)
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4  # CURRENT
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Maintenance Best Practices

#### Proactive Maintenance
1. **Regular Updates**: Don't wait for failures to update dependencies
2. **Testing First**: Always test updates in staging before production
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Implement changes incrementally
4. **Documentation**: Keep all documentation current with changes
5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor workflow health and performance

#### Change Management
1. **Version Control**: All workflow changes must be version controlled
2. **Review Process**: Peer review for all workflow modifications
3. **Testing Requirements**: Comprehensive testing before production deployment
4. **Rollback Plans**: Always have rollback procedures ready
5. **Communication**: Notify team of significant workflow changes

### Security Best Practices

#### Secure Workflow Design
```yaml
# Security-focused workflow design
name: Secure Deployment
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, production]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allow manual triggers

permissions:
  contents: read      # Minimal required permissions
  actions: read
  security-events: write

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production  # Use environment protection
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}  # Use built-in token
```

#### Secret Management
- Use environment-specific secrets
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Validate secret presence before use
- Never log secret values
- Use GitHub's built-in secret masking
