- **Solution Implemented**: Mandatory real-time monitoring protocol
- **Result**: 100% accurate deployment status reporting

### **üîí Non-Negotiable Requirements**

**Every Deployment Must Include:**

1. ‚úÖ **Real-time Monitoring**: `gh run watch --exit-status` executed immediately after deployment trigger
2. ‚úÖ **Exit Status Verification**: Confirm exit status is 0 (success) before claiming deployment success
3. ‚úÖ **Documentation**: GitHub Actions run ID must be documented in all deployment reports
4. ‚úÖ **Evidence**: Include monitoring evidence in deployment documentation
5. ‚úÖ **Accountability**: Never report deployment success without GitHub Actions verification

- ‚ùå Skip real-time monitoring during deployment
- ‚ùå Use alternative monitoring methods as primary verification

**ALWAYS Do These:**

- ‚úÖ Execute `gh run watch --exit-status` for every deployment
- ‚úÖ Monitor until workflow completion with exit status 0
- ‚úÖ Document GitHub Actions run ID in all deployment reports
- ‚úÖ Include monitoring evidence in deployment documentation
