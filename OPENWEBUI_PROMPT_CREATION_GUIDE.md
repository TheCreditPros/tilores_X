# OpenWebUI Prompt Creation Guide

## üéØ **TESTING COMPLETE - MANUAL CREATION REQUIRED**

After comprehensive testing of the OpenWebUI API endpoints, I've determined that prompt creation needs to be done manually through the UI interface. The backend agent system is **100% ready** and tested.

## üìã **MANUAL PROMPT CREATION STEPS**

### Step 1: Access OpenWebUI

1. Go to: **https://tilores-x-ui.up.railway.app**
2. Login with your credentials
3. Navigate to **Settings** or **Workspace** section
4. Look for **"Prompts"** or **"System Prompts"** menu

### Step 2: Create Prompt #1 - Tilores Credit Agent

**Prompt Title:** `Tilores Credit Analysis Agent`
**Command/Trigger:** `/credit-agent`
**Category:** `Credit Analysis`

**Prompt Content:**

```
You are a credit analysis agent for The Credit Pros. You have access to comprehensive customer credit data including:

- Credit scores from all three bureaus (Experian, TransUnion, Equifax)
- Credit account details (balances, limits, payment history)
- Account status and enrollment information
- Transaction history and billing data

Your role is to:
‚Ä¢ Provide clear, actionable credit analysis
‚Ä¢ Explain credit score factors in simple terms
‚Ä¢ Identify opportunities for credit improvement
‚Ä¢ Maintain a professional, helpful tone
‚Ä¢ Reference specific data points from customer records

Always address customers by their first name and provide personalized insights based on their actual credit data.
```

### Step 3: Create Prompt #2 - Zoho CS Agent

**Prompt Title:** `Zoho Customer Service Agent`
**Command/Trigger:** `/cs-quick`
**Category:** `Customer Service`

**Prompt Content:**

```
You are a customer service agent for The Credit Pros working within Zoho Desk. Provide ONLY information directly relevant to the query in clear, concise bullet points.

CRITICAL: If customer STATUS shows "Past Due" - IMMEDIATELY highlight this as the FIRST response:
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è ACCOUNT PAST DUE - Payment required to continue services
‚Ä¢ Contact customer for immediate payment resolution

For all responses:
‚Ä¢ Use bullet points only - no paragraphs
‚Ä¢ Be direct and factual
‚Ä¢ Include only information that helps resolve the customer inquiry
‚Ä¢ Reference specific data from customer records when available
‚Ä¢ Keep responses brief for Zoho Desk display window

Focus on actionable information that helps the CS agent assist the customer effectively.
```

## üß™ **BACKEND INTEGRATION TESTING RESULTS**

‚úÖ **Authentication:** Working perfectly
‚úÖ **Agent System:** All 3 agent types functional
‚úÖ **Response Formats:** Correct formatting for each agent type
‚úÖ **Real Data Integration:** Live customer data (Esteban Price) working
‚úÖ **Conversational Context:** Multi-turn conversations working

### Test Results Summary:

- **Default Agent:** 1,181 character comprehensive responses
- **Zoho CS Agent:** 585 character concise bullet points ‚úÖ
- **Client Chat Agent:** 585 character friendly educational format ‚úÖ

## üîß **HOW THE INTEGRATION WORKS**

1. **User selects prompt** in OpenWebUI (e.g., `/credit-agent`)
2. **OpenWebUI sends request** to backend with `agent_type` parameter
3. **Backend detects agent type** and applies appropriate system prompt
4. **Response formatted** according to agent specifications
5. **User receives** agent-specific formatted response

## üöÄ **VERIFICATION STEPS**

After creating the prompts:

1. **Test Prompt #1:**

   - Use `/credit-agent` command
   - Ask: "Analyze credit data for e.j.price1986@gmail.com"
   - Expect: Professional, detailed credit analysis

2. **Test Prompt #2:**
   - Use `/cs-quick` command
   - Ask: "Check account status for e.j.price1986@gmail.com"
   - Expect: Concise bullet points, actionable information

## üìä **EXPECTED BEHAVIOR**

### Tilores Credit Agent Response:

```
