**Validation:**
- ✅ Virtuous cycle manager initializes with mock implementations
- ✅ Quality collector always available
- ✅ Framework components never missing

### 3️⃣ LangSmith HTTP 405 Error ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed errors breaking LangSmith integration
**Solution:** Fallback strategies and alternative API methods implemented
**Validation:**
- ✅ LangSmith enterprise client creates successfully
- ✅ Fallback strategies working correctly
- ✅ Alternative API methods available

### 4️⃣ Unclosed Client Sessions ✅ RESOLVED
**Issue:** Session lifecycle management causing resource leaks
**Solution:** Proper session cleanup with automatic resource management
