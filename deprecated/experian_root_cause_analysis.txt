=== ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: EXPERIAN INCONGRUENCY ===

ARCHITECTURAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
The code has inconsistent data processing architecture between different credit data types.

UTILIZATION DATA PROCESSING (BUREAU-SPECIFIC - WORKING):
├── Experian/TransUnion: ID="PT016", Type="creditSummary"
├── Equifax: NO ID, Type="creditAttributes"
├── Result: Each bureau processed separately with specific logic

LATE PAYMENT DATA PROCESSING (GLOBAL - BROKEN):
├── All bureaus: Same CREDIT_LIABILITY query structure
├── Processing: Global late_payments[] list (no bureau separation)
├── Result: Experian data lost or filtered out in global aggregation

ROOT CAUSE: ARCHITECTURAL INCONSISTENCY
The system was designed with bureau-specific logic for utilization data but global logic for late payments.
This creates different processing paths that handle Experian data differently.

TECHNICAL FLOW:
1. GraphQL Query: Identical structure for all bureaus ✅
2. Data Retrieval: Same CREDIT_LIABILITY fields for all bureaus ✅
3. Processing Logic: Different architectures ❌
   ├── Utilization: Bureau-specific filters and processing ✅
   ├── Late Payments: Global aggregation without bureau isolation ❌

WHY EXPERIAN FAILS:
- Experian late payment data enters global processing pipeline
- Global deduplication logic may filter out Experian entries
- No bureau-specific handling to preserve Experian data integrity
- Experian data gets lost in the global aggregation process

SOLUTION REQUIRED:
Implement bureau-specific late payment processing similar to utilization logic.
