# Decisions Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains documentation of key decisions made during the development and evolution of the Tilores_X project. It serves as a record of the reasoning behind important architectural, technical, and strategic choices.

## Why Document Decisions?

Documenting decisions provides several benefits:

1. **Context Preservation**: Captures the context and reasoning at the time decisions were made
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Helps new team members understand why things are the way they are
3. **Future Decision Making**: Provides precedent and patterns for future decisions
4. **Avoiding Rework**: Prevents revisiting decisions without understanding previous considerations
5. **Accountability**: Creates a record of decision ownership and stakeholder involvement

## Decision Record Structure

Each decision document should follow this structure:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title of the decision
2. **Status**: Current status (proposed, accepted, rejected, deprecated, superseded)
3. **Context**: Background and situation leading to the need for a decision
4. **Decision**: The decision that was made
5. **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult as a result of this decision
6. **Alternatives Considered**: Other options that were considered and why they weren't chosen
7. **References**: Links to related documents, discussions, or external resources

## Naming Convention

Decision documents should be named using the following convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-brief-title.md
```

For example: `2025-08-15-rebuild-rationale.md`

## Current Decisions

The following key decisions have been documented:

- [Rebuild Rationale](rebuild-rationale.md): Why Tilores_X was created as a rebuild

## Template

When documenting a new decision, use the following template:

```markdown
# Decision: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]

If superseded, include a link to the new decision.

## Date

YYYY-MM-DD

## Decision Makers

- Person A
- Person B
- Person C

## Context

Describe the context and background that led to the need for a decision. Include:

- Problem being solved
- Constraints and requirements
- Relevant facts that influenced the decision
- External factors or pressures

## Decision

Clearly state the decision that was made. Be specific and unambiguous.

## Consequences

Describe the resulting context after applying the decision, including:

- Positive consequences
- Negative consequences
- Risks introduced
- Dependencies created
- Requirements for future work

## Alternatives Considered

List the alternatives that were considered:

### Alternative 1

Description of the alternative and why it wasn't chosen.

### Alternative 2

Description of the alternative and why it wasn't chosen.

## References

- Link to relevant discussions
- External resources
- Related decisions
```

## Maintenance

Decision documents should be:

- Created at the time decisions are made
- Updated if the status changes
- Linked to from related documentation
- Referenced in code or architecture documents when relevant

## Historical Context

Even if a decision is later reversed or superseded, the original decision document should be preserved to maintain historical context. When a decision is superseded, update its status and include a link to the new decision.
