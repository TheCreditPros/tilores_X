# Tilores_X Memory Bank Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the memory bank structure in the tilores_X project directory. All necessary documentation files have been created and need to be organized into the proper directory structure.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the tilores_X project directory
- Permission to create directories and move files
- Basic familiarity with file system operations

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Directory Structure

Navigate to the tilores_X project directory and create the following directory structure:

```bash
cd tilores_X
mkdir -p memory-bank/decisions
mkdir -p memory-bank/updates
mkdir -p memory-bank/status-reports
mkdir -p memory-bank/architecture
```

### Step 2: Move Documentation Files

Move the created documentation files from the Tilores-Jul10 workspace to their appropriate locations in tilores_X:

```bash
# Core documentation files
mv ../Tilores-Jul10/tilores_X_memory_bank_project-status.md memory-bank/project-status.md
mv ../Tilores-Jul10/tilores_X_memory_bank_project-overview.md memory-bank/project-overview.md
mv ../Tilores-Jul10/tilores_X_memory_bank_migration-from-legacy.md memory-bank/migration-from-legacy.md

# Decision documentation
mv ../Tilores-Jul10/tilores_X_memory_bank_decisions_README.md memory-bank/decisions/README.md
mv ../Tilores-Jul10/tilores_X_memory_bank_decisions_rebuild-rationale.md memory-bank/decisions/rebuild-rationale.md

# Updates documentation
mv ../Tilores-Jul10/tilores_X_memory_bank_updates_development-log.md memory-bank/updates/development-log.md

# Status reports documentation
mv ../Tilores-Jul10/tilores_X_memory_bank_status-reports_README.md memory-bank/status-reports/README.md

# Architecture documentation
mv ../Tilores-Jul10/tilores_X_memory_bank_architecture_README.md memory-bank/architecture/README.md
```

### Step 3: Verify Structure

After moving the files, your tilores_X directory should have the following structure:

```
tilores_X/
├── .env.template
├── .gitignore
├── core_app.py
├── main_enhanced.py
├── README.md
├── redis_cache.py
├── requirements.txt
├── test_setup.py
└── memory-bank/
    ├── project-status.md
    ├── project-overview.md
    ├── migration-from-legacy.md
    ├── decisions/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   └── rebuild-rationale.md
    ├── updates/
    │   └── development-log.md
    ├── status-reports/
    │   └── README.md
    └── architecture/
        └── README.md
```

### Step 4: Create Memory Bank Index

Create a main index file for the memory bank:

```bash
cd tilores_X/memory-bank
cat > README.md << 'EOF'
# Tilores_X Memory Bank

## Overview

This memory bank serves as the central repository for tracking project progress, decisions, and context for the tilores_X project. It replaces reliance on the legacy Tilores-Jul10 workspace memory bank.

## Contents

- **[Project Status](project-status.md)**: Current status and overview of tilores_X
- **[Project Overview](project-overview.md)**: What tilores_X is and its relationship to legacy system
- **[Migration from Legacy](migration-from-legacy.md)**: Strategy for transitioning from Tilores-Jul10
- **[Decisions/](decisions/)**: Documentation of key architectural and technical decisions
- **[Updates/](updates/)**: Development log and progress tracking
- **[Status Reports/](status-reports/)**: Regular project status reports
- **[Architecture/](architecture/)**: Technical architecture documentation

## Usage

This memory bank should be updated regularly as the project evolves. Each directory contains README files with specific guidance on how to contribute to that section.

## Maintenance

- Update development log with each significant change
- Create decision records for important choices
- Generate status reports at regular intervals
- Keep architecture documentation current with implementation

```

### Step 5: Update Git Tracking

Ensure the memory bank is tracked in git:

```bash
cd tilores_X
git add memory-bank/
git commit -m "Add memory bank structure for project tracking"
```

## Validation

To verify the setup is complete, check that:

1. All directories are created in the correct locations
2. All documentation files are moved and accessible
3. The main memory-bank README.md exists and is complete
4. Files are tracked in git

## Next Steps

With the memory bank structure in place, you can:

1. Begin using the development log for tracking changes
2. Create status reports as the project progresses
3. Document new decisions using the provided templates
4. Expand architecture documentation as needed

## Support

If you encounter issues during setup, refer to the individual README files in each memory-bank subdirectory for specific guidance.
