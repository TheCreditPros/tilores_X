3. **In Progress**: What is currently being worked on
4. **Blockers/Challenges**: Any issues impeding progress
5. **Next Steps**: Planned work for the next period
6. **Metrics**: Key performance indicators and metrics
7. **Resources**: Current resource allocation and needs

## Naming Convention

Status reports should be named using the following convention:

```
status-YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

For example: `status-2025-08-30.md`
