**Key Insights:**  
  
- Your **Experian score** of **668** is the highest among your reports, which is great! 🎯 This indicates that you have some positive credit behaviors.  
  
- The **Equifax** and **TransUnion** scores are lower, mainly due to past **late payments**. The presence of a few **30-day late payments** on your history can negatively impact your score, so we want to work on keeping those payments timely! ⚠️  
  
- You have a mix of **revolving** and **installment accounts**, which is excellent, as having different types of credit can enhance your credit profile.  
  
- Your **credit utilization** (the ratio of your credit balances to your limits) could use improvement. Aim to keep your balances below **30%** of your total credit limit. For instance, with a total limit of $6,301.00, try to keep your balance under **$1,890.30**.  
  
**Next Steps:**  
  
- Timely Payments:** Focus on making all your payments on time to avoid future late payments. Setting up automatic payments or reminders can help! ✅  
  
- Monitor Utilization:** Work on paying down your balances, especially if you’re close to that **30% utilization** threshold. You’re currently at approximately **9.9%** utilization, which is good, but the lower, the better! 🌟  
  
- Limit New Credit Inquiries:** Be cautious about applying for new credit in the near future, as multiple inquiries can further impact your score.  
  
- Celebrate Your Progress:** Every on-time payment counts! 🎉 Each month without a late payment helps improve your credit score.
