# Production Tool Execution Fix Report

## Issue Identified
**Critical Regression**: Customer search queries like "Find customer Dawn Bruton" are failing because tool execution results are not being properly processed and returned to users.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Tool Calling**: ✅ Working correctly - LLM successfully calls `tilores_search` with proper arguments
2. **Tool Execution**: ❌ Failing - Tool results not being executed and integrated into final response
3. **Response Processing**: ❌ Failing - Raw LangChain response format returned instead of processed customer data

## Evidence
- LLM correctly generates: `{"name": "tilores_search", "args": {"query": "Dawn Bruton"}}`
- System returns raw tool call structure instead of executing tool and returning customer data
- Users see: "Unfortunately, no customer data was found" instead of actual customer information

## Technical Details
- **File**: `core_app.py` lines 2227-2298 (tool execution logic)
- **Issue**: Tool execution workflow not completing properly
- **Impact**: Complete loss of customer search functionality in production

## Fix Required
Comprehensive fix needed for tool execution and result processing logic to restore customer search functionality.

**Status**: CRITICAL - Production functionality broken
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE - Customer service capabilities compromised
