Accurate Customer Identification\n2. Handling Multiple Identifiers\n3. Disambiguation Techniques\n\n---\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Accurate Customer Identification:**\n   - Ensure that each customer is uniquely identified using a primary identifier (e.g., email, phone number, or customer ID). \n   - Validate the primary identifier against existing records to confirm accuracy. If a match is found, update the record with any new information provided.\n   - **Example:** If a customer provides an email address that matches an existing record, update the record with any new details (e.g., address, phone number) while retaining the original identifier.\n\n2. **Handling Multiple Identifiers:**\n   - When processing customer data, aggregate multiple identifiers to create a comprehensive customer profile. \n   - Prioritize identifiers based on reliability (e.g., email > phone number > social media handles).\n   - **Example:** If a customer has both an email and a phone number, use the email as the primary identifier for communication but store the phone number for verification purposes.\n\n3. **Disambiguation Techniques:**\n   - Implement algorithms to resolve conflicts when multiple records may refer to the same customer. Use a confidence scoring system to determine the likelihood of matches.\n   - If the confidence score is below 80%, flag the record for manual review. Ensure that the review process includes cross-referencing with additional data sources (e.g., transaction history, customer support interactions).\n   - **Example:** If two records exist with similar names but different addresses, check transaction history to see if they have made purchases from the same location. If not, flag for review.\n\n---\n\n**Quality Criteria and Expectations:**\n\n- **Identification Accuracy:** Aim for a minimum of 95% accuracy in identifying customers based on primary identifiers.\n- **Response Completeness:** Ensure that all customer profiles include at least three identifiers and relevant demographic information.\n- **Confidence Scoring:** Maintain a confidence score of 85% or higher for all resolved identities. Records with lower scores must be reviewed and corrected.\n\n---\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n\n- **Duplicate Identifiers:** If a customer provides multiple identifiers that conflict (e.g., two different email addresses), prioritize the most recent identifier and flag the older one for review.\n- **Incomplete Data:** If a customer profile lacks essential information (e.g., missing phone number), initiate a follow-up process to gather the missing data.\n- **Similar Names:** For customers with similar names, utilize additional identifiers (e.g., date of birth, address) to differentiate between records. If still ambiguous, escalate for manual verification.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBy adhering to these guidelines and continuously monitoring quality metrics, we can enhance our customer identity resolution process, bridge the quality gap, and achieve our target quality score of 90% or higher. Regularly review and refine these processes based on feedback and performance data to ensure ongoing improvement.\n\n--- \n\n**End of Prompt**",
