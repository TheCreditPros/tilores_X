## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Empty Query Handling (CRITICAL - Immediate Fix Required)

- **Issue:** HTTP 500 errors for empty queries
- **Impact:** Poor user experience, potential system crashes
- **Frequency:** 100% failure rate for empty/whitespace queries
- **Recommendation:** Add input validation before processing

```python
# Suggested fix in direct_credit_api_fixed.py
if not query or not query.strip():
    return {
        "choices": [{
            "message": {
                "content": "Please provide a question or query about customer data."
            }
        }]
    }
```

### 2. Performance Bottlenecks (MEDIUM Priority)

- **Issue:** Some queries taking 15-26 seconds
- **Affected Queries:**
  - "detailed credit bureau comparison"
  - "complete transaction history and payment patterns"
- **Root Cause:** Complex GraphQL queries without optimization
- **Recommendation:** Implement query optimization and caching

### 3. Transaction Analysis Reliability (MEDIUM Priority)

- **Issue:** 37.5% failure rate for transaction queries
- **Impact:** Inconsistent customer service experience
- **Recommendation:** Debug transaction data retrieval logic
